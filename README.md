# UPDATE
Upgraded to work over Moltin v2 APIs and is now using the latest [js-sdk](https://github.com/moltin/js-sdk)

# Adventure Works catalog for Moltin

A set of scripts to setup the [Adventure Works](https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/125550) product catalog in your [Moltin](https://moltin.com/) store.

## Motivation

I was building a conversational eCommerce chatbot for [my talk at API Strat](http://boston2016.apistrat.com/speakers/pavel-veller) and I needed a robust but easy to use API-first commerce platform with a decent free plan. This is how I discovered [Moltin](https://moltin.com/).

The next thing I needed was a sample store that would have categories and products with images and variants (like `color` and `size`). I also needed historical orders to build a recommendation model with [Cognitive Services Recommendations API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/recommendations-api). This is how I discovered [Adventure Works](https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/125550).

## Usage

To create your Adventure Works catalog in Moltin you'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (go for the latest 6.x as I am using ES6 straight up with no build step and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) Then:

* Sign up for Moltin and create a new store. Go to the store settings to get your API keys

* Set up two environment variables

```
export MOLTIN_CLIENT_ID="<Client ID>"
export MOLTIN_CLIENT_SECRET="<Client Secret>"
```

* Download Adventure Works OLTP Script from [here](https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/downloads/get/880662) and unzip (for example to `~/Downloads/Adventure Works 2014 OLTP Script`)

* Clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:pveller/adventureworks-moltin.git
```

* Install packages

```
npm install
```

* Run `app.js` and supply the path to your Adventure Works files as a command line argument

```
node app.js "/Users/<yourself>/Downloads/Adventure Works 2014 OLTP Script"
```

It will run for about ten minutes and you should see something like this in your console:
